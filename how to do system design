Steps to design a system:
1. gather functional requirements - what are the functionalities that this system must support
2. gather non-functional requirements - how system should behave eg: availability, scalability, performance, high concurrency, latency, thoroughput
3. Back of the envelope estimations - Determine QPS(Queries per second), TPS(transactions per second), read-heavy vs write-heavy 
4. API design
5. Data models along with choice of DB with some pseudo-code on how the services will work
6. High level design based on functional requirements - lb, api gw, message queues, breakdown of services based on apis, s2s communication protocol, client-server communication protocols
7. Enhancements to high level design based on non-functional requirements
